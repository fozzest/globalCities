						<p class="content__item-description">
What does it mean to connect in a post-COVID world? With the pressure to not enter or move through public spaces mounting, I became interested in the ideas of physical movement, and movement or networks in the digital space, which has taken on an even greater role as the primary space people communicate, trade, play, and gather information from. The methods of communication have shifted as the physicality of our worlds has also changed; as we convert our private spaces into areas for public connection, our new digital networks require a new apparatus for connection. The remoteness of our lives define, and are defined by a new system of nodes, nodes that are remote, less-discernible, almost invisible, yet formidable and important in our new global makeup. Physical interactions are now moved online, the transaction now does not occur between bodies, but through remote centres that are easily monitored and influenced. As we move into interior enclosures, our connections are ironically more exposed than ever before. These are the new nodes of intersection. . Pictured: Xinjiang re-education camp, Xinjiang.

						<h2 class="content__item-title">Commons</h2>
						<p class="content__item-description">In the past, sharing was physical. Buying and selling goods, socialising, sexual encounters, public dissonance, all occurred in real spaces. The public commons and private dwelling were easily defined. Routes for trade were known; produce arrived from the road and entered the market, then was physically consumed. Cities defined these connections, the city was a node for intersections and sharing, a physical symbol and apparatus for producing and disseminating knowledge, power, and capital.

						<h2 class="content__item-title">Remote</h2>
						<p class="content__item-description">Remoteness defines the new nodes of intersections. The ability to surveil and reveal the private is a characteristic of these nodes. Central Asian Uyghurs are taken and concentrated in remote camps across Western China for reeducation and monitoring. Refugees attempting to enter Australia are held on the island of Niue indefinitely. Data centres are kept in deserts across North America for security purposes, kept in close proximity to military bases. As the public is pushed into the private, these spaces mix. Working form home, sharing cultural experiences, resining romantically involved, all occurs with single individuals expressing themselves from their homes. In the past, these connections remained physical in the sense that information was passed direct form individual to individual. Now, private sharing is extrapolated and made public, as the digital encounters between individuals are pushed across remote data centres, surveilled, documented, and shared. The access to information and ease of sharing online and the remoteness of these centres acts as a veil and lubricant, inviting the public into the private, and shifting our nodes of connection from physically present spaces, to remote and ambiguous ones. Spaces that don’t cross the public park as much as they don’t cross the private mind. Out of sight and out of mind, these remote centres become the nodes and centres that observe and dictate our lives. Pictured: Indian Ocean</p>

						<h2 class="content__item-title">Covert</h2>
						<p class="content__item-description">If a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it, does it make a sound? If a state monitors the internet and no one knows, did they harvest any information? If an online public is surveilled and silenced and that online community can’t cry out that they have been silenced, did they ever exist in the first place? The loss of physicality to communication in public spaces threatens to shift how we think about speech and sharing. The destruction of commons to protect populations from physical disease transports us to mediums that are easily surveilled and silenced. Our voices are channelled through nodes such as these in Hollywood, FL, where internet cables from Africa and Europe touch down in continental USA. Conversations amongst people in two private homes become revealed at a distant beachhead in south Florida, where the private is removed from its enclosure.

						<h2 class="content__item-title">Who we are</h2>
						<p class="content__item-description">On March 12, when wide scale lockdown was enacted across Italy, traffic on the site Pornhub.com increased by nearly 60%. Our modes of connection have become digitised, where bytes of virtual data now play the role of romance, physical connection, and social conversation. Our identities become information that travels across satellites or fibre optic cables. The private room is transported through new roads and routes. Public enters the private, but more importantly the lives of the private enter the exposed domain of the public. Individuals intermix and intertwine in remote centres, away from the protection of the physical self.

						<h2 class="content__item-title">Where we are</h2>
						<p class="content__item-description">The Silk Roads across Central Asia became a place for cultural exchange alongside political and economic shifts. It is no wonder that the famous Dark Web site that shared illicit content and drugs named itself the Silk Road in homage for this past network of trade. Criss-crossed in roads, oil and gas pipelines, railroads, and internet cables, Central Asia remains, and grows as an important part of how individuals around the globe connect with one another. In the past, exchange was carried by physical beings in physical spaces. Today, and in the future, sharing will be of data. We think of ourselves as being real beings safe in real private homes. But the public has now entered the private, and the individual connects to the public through digital means. The physical home now acts as a guise; it tricks one into thinking they still remain in a private environment. But our lives now don’t play out in front of us, they take place thousands of kilometres away, as data requests, pulls, posts, and transports itself through small centres in remote parts of the planet. The public and private individual is treated as one piece of information, surveilled, traded, and observed as it moves across physical nodes as digital data. Pictured: Port of Hong Kong </p>

						<p class="content__item-description">Below is a short video documenting many of the new invisible nodes that make up our connections today. Spanning Florida, Greenland, Central Africa, The East Pacific, Europe, and Central Asia, the modes of connection and distribution are increasingly becoming more remote as we as individuals become linked closer and closer together. Gas pipelines, concentration camps, planned airships, data centres, and internet cable routes are all shown. Physical proximity grows as surveillance, speed of sharing, data amounts, hacking, porn usage, video calling, and digital currencies increase. The points of intersection today and in the future symbolise our individual remoteness; we connect over ambiguous services in unseen ways, private and in our home but silently visible, documented, and traceable to many. Out of sight, the way we share is physically private but fundamentally public. As the lines between individual and shared spaces and experiences blur, the new mediums of connection are abstract, yet determine how our future will be shaped. <a href="https://youtu.be/YVJwvGjgrGQ" style="color:red">Click here to view on youtube</a>.</p>
